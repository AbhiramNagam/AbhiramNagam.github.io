Module 1:
	Introduction:
		Amazon EC2 is a type of virtual server.
	Cloud Computing:
		Deployment models for cloud computing:
			Cloud based, On-premises,hybrid.
			
Module 2:
	Introduction:
		EC2 -> (Caas)Compute as a service.
	Amazon EC2 Instance Types:
		General Purpose,Compute Optimized,Memory optimized,Accelerated computing, storage optimized.
		Examples:
			General purpose: 
				It provides a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.
				Includes small and medium databases.
			Compute optimized:
				HPC(High performance computing)
				Ideal for batch processing workloads.
			Memory optimized:This scenario might be a high-performance database or a workload that involves performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data.
			Accelerated computing: floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching,game streaming, application streaming.
			Storage optimized: 	
				Distributed file systems,data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
				Application with high IOPS(input/output operations per second) requirements.
	
	EC2 Pricing:
		On-Demand: Ideal for short-term,irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted.
		Reserved Instances:
			1yr/3yr commitment
			Capacity Reservation meaning(Works only when availability zone is specified) : Fixing maximum number of EC2 instances needed.
			Standard Reserved Instances:
				upto 72% off of on-demand prices.
				AZ is fixed.
				Instance Type, size, OS, Tenancy, Region are fixed.
			Convertible Reserved Instances:
				upto 54% off of on-demand prices.(Info from https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/)
				Different Availability zones, different instance types.	
			After the plan is completed, billing changes to On-Demand unless a similar Reserved instance plan is taken which matches the instance attributes(instance family and size, Region, platform, and tenancy).
		Savings plan:
			upto 72% off of on-demand prices.
			EC2 savings plan:
				Hourly spend commitment to instance family and region.
			Don't need to specify upfront what EC2 instance type and size (for example, m5.xlarge), OS, and tenancy to get a discount.(????)
			AZs can also be changed.
		Spot Instances:
			90% off of On-Demand prices.
			Better for jobs that can withstand interruption.
			Gives 2 min warning to finish up the work.
		Dedicated Hosts:
			Most expensive.
			You can use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to help maintain license compliance.
			On-demand dedicated hosts, dedicated hosts reservations are available.
			
	Scaling Amazon EC2:
		Dynamic scaling: 	Responds to changing demand.
		Predictive scaling:	automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
		To scale faster, you can use dynamic scaling and predictive scaling together.
		Auto scaling group:
			when desired instances is not set, then it defaults to the minimum instances.
		
	Directing Traffic with Elastic Load Balancing :
		de-coupling example: seprating front end and backend with ELB
		ELB is regional

		Scaling up = Vertical Scaling
		scaling down= opposite of scaling up
		
		Scaling out(increasing) = Horizontal Scaling
		scaling in(decreasing) = opposite of scaling out
	
	Messaging and Queuing:
		Tightly coupled architecture: when a service B depending on service A, if serive B goes down , then service A still continous sending data to service B which will be lost for sure.
		
		Loosely coupled architecture: Single failure won't cause cascading failures. (It introduces a queue in the middle)
		considering the example in Tightly coupled architecture, eventhough service B fails, service A will continue sending data to the queue so they will reach service B after service B becomes available again.
		
		SQS: Simple Queue service
		SNS: Simple Notification service
		
		SNS is a publish/subscribe service, but not SQS.
		
		Monolithic: Components are tightly coupled
		Microservices: Components are loosely coupled
		
	Additional Compute Serives:
		serverless:	You cannot see or access the underlying infrastructure.
		serverless compute serives:
			Lambda,Fargate	
		
		ECS and EKS are container orchestration tools
		Docker uses OS level virtualization to deliver software in containers.
		
		Containers(ECS and EKS) run on top of EC2 instances.
		
		But if we wanna run ECS or EKS as serverless, we need to use Amazon Fargate.
		
		Amazon Fargate: A serverless service to run ECS and EKS.
		
		Savings Plan also applies for AWS Fargate and Lambda.
		
		
Module 3:
	AWS Global Infrastructure:
		Amazon Braket: Amazon's new quantum computing platform.
		
		Region : A geographical area that contains AWS resources.
		
		Availability Zone: A single data center or group of data centers within a Region.
		
		
	Edge Locations:
		An edge location is a data center that an AWS service uses to perform service-specific operations. 
		
		AWS Outposts is a service that you can use to run AWS infrastructure, services, and tools in your own on-premises data center in a hybrid approach.
		
		Cloud Front: Amazon's CDN.
		
		Route 53: Amazon's DNS serives.
		
		Edge locations run Cloud front and Route 53.
		
	How to provision AWS Resources:
		Aws Beanstalk helps you to focus on your business application, not the infrastructure.
		To create automated and repeatable deployments:
			AWS CloudFormation: Infrastructure as code tool used to define a wide variety of AWS resources. (with json/yaml templates)
			It supports not just EC2, but also storage, databases, analytics , machine learning,etc..
		
		Beanstalk and CloudFormation are known as managed tools to interact with AWS services.
	
	Summary:
		Logical clusters of data centers make up Availability zones.
	
	An origin is the server from which CloudFront gets your files. Examples of CloudFront origins include Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and web servers.
	
	The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is used to automate actions for AWS services and applications through scripts.
	
	The AWS Management Console includes wizards and workflows that you can use to complete tasks in AWS services.
		
	Software development kits (SDKs) enable you to develop AWS applications in supported programming languages.


Module 4:
	Connectivity to AWS:
		Internet gateway: Allows traffic from public to VPC
		Virtual private gateway: The data is encrypted by a VPN and it will only allow traffic from approved network to VPC.
		AWS Direct Connect: A dedicated private connection between your data center and VPC.
	Subnets and Network Access Control Lists:
		Security Group:	
			Stateful
			Only checks permission when packet is coming inside and remembers if it is allowed and doesn't check the response as it already knows if it is allowed.
			A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.
			By default, Security groups allow no traffic to come inside, but allows all traffic to go outside.
		Network ACL:
			Network Access Control Lists(NACLs) are used for subnets.
			A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
			Stateless
			It checks everytime when a packet either tries to enter or leave the subnet.
			By default,	default NACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic, and custom  NACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic.
	Global Networking:
		Customer -->DNS Resolver-->DNS Server
		Route 53:
			Amazon Route 53 connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS (such as Amazon EC2 instances and load balancers). It can route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.
			Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names.

Module 5:
	Instance Stores and EBS:
		Instance Store: 
			Attatched physically to instance and data will be erased after instance stops.
		EBS:
			A block of volume not physically attatched to instance, and UPDATES ONLY THE NEW PART OF A FILE. And can create incremental snapshots.
			Solid State by default.
			Has HDD options.
			16TiB storage limit.
	S3:
		Common thing in S3 Standard, S3 standard IA,S3 instant retrieval,S3 flexible retrieval, S3 Glacier Deep Archive: 3 availability zones within the same region.
		Individual object size limit: 5TB.
		Unlimited Storage.
		99.999999999% durable.
		Regionally distributed.
		Serverless.	
		S3 glacier vault lock :
			write once and read many.(WORM) 
		S3 Lifecycle policy:
			Move data between different S3 tiers based on time.
		S3 Intelligent tiering:
			monitors objects to change tiers of S3 from standard to IA and vice versa if (based on last 30 days usage).
	
	EFS:
		EFS vs EBS:
			EBS:
				Need to be in same availability zone as the instance.(Availability zone level resource)
				Volumes do not automatically scale.
			EFS:
				Linux File system
				Regional Resource.
				Automatically scales.
				uses block storage.
				On premises servers can access EFS using Direct Connect.
	RDS:
		RDS includes:
			Amazon Aurora
			PostgreSQL
			MySQL
			MariaDB
			Oracle Database
			Microsoft SQL Server
		
		Amazon Aurora:
			Consider Amazon Aurora if your workloads require high availability. It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.
			1/10th cost of other enterprise DBs.
	Dynamo DB:
		key-value database
		serverless
		Automatic scaling
	Redshift:
		Data warehouse as service.
		In cooperation with Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can directly run a single SQL query against exabytes of unstructured data running in data lakes. 
		Also useful for big data BI solutions.
		Can be used for data analytics
		Helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.
		
	DMS:
		Source DB can be operational during migration.
		Homogenous:
			Source and destination DBs are of same type.
		Heterogenous:
			step1 :	uses AWS Schema conversion tool to convert source schema and code to match the target database
			step2 : Migrating data using DMS.
		
		Consolidation:
			Combining more DBs to one DB in migration.
		Continuous replication:
			Sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration.
	Additional Database services:
		Read in skillbuilder.
	
Module 6:
	AWS Shared Responsibility model :
		AWS will not deploy the patch for the OS., it may just notify us.
	User permissions and access:
		Roles:
			Roles are temporary permissions which can be given to : AWS resources, Users, External identies, Applications.
			Role is the highest priority. i.e, if someone already has a identity, if role is applied to them, then the rules in role will be applicable for them instead of old rules.
			Before an IAM user, application, or service can assume an IAM role, they must be granted permissions to switch to the role.
			When someone assumes an IAM role, they abandon all previous permissions that they had under a previous role and assume the permissions of the new role. 
		
		IAM(Identity and access management) provides authentication and authorization as service.
		
		Groups/users can have policies .
		Users can be assigned to groups.
		
		IAM policy:
			An IAM policy is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources.  
			It is attached to users/groups.
	Aws organizations:
		SCPs can be applied to OUs, and individual member account.
		In AWS Organizations, you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to the organization root, an individual member account, or an OU. An SCP affects all IAM users, groups, and roles within an account, including the AWS account root user.
		You can apply IAM policies to IAM users, groups, or roles. You cannot apply an IAM policy to the AWS account root user.
	Compliance:
		GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation) : deals with consumer data in the EU.	
		HIPAA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Healthcare compliance requirements in the US.
		
		AWS Artifact Agreements:
			Signing an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS services. 
			You can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Ex:HIPAA.
		AWS Artifact reports:
			Provides compliance reports from third-party auditors.
		Customer Compliance Center:
			Read customer compliance stories to discover how companies in regulated industries have solved various compliance, governance, and audit challenges.
			AWS answers to key compliance questions.
			An overview of AWS risk and compliance.
			An auditing security checklist.
